Java ATM Machine Console Application

A simple console-based Java project that simulates a basic ATM (Automated Teller Machine). This program supports login authentication and basic banking operations like balance check, deposits, withdrawals, and mini statements — all via terminal interaction.

---

## Description

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming in Java using core concepts like:
- Encapsulation via classes (`ATM.java`)
- Interfaces and abstraction (`AtmOperationsInterface`)
- Implementation logic and transaction history with preserved order (`AtmOperationsImp`)
- Real-time user interaction using the Scanner class

Ideal for beginners who want to learn **Java OOP** with real-life logic simulation.

## Features

- Login system using account number & PIN
- Deposit and withdraw funds (withdrawals must be in ₹500 multiples)
- Mini statement (preserves order of transactions)
- Error handling and retry logic for invalid inputs
- Clean, user-friendly console output
